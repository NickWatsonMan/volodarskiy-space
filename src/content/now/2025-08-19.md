Next two and a half weeks will be tough. I have to back up another team as Business Analyst due to the paternal leave of their Business Analyst. Whatâ€™s even more pressing is that they have critical quarterly commitments that are on track, but very close to spilling over. I plan to do my best and forget the rest. But this situation drains energy a lot.
