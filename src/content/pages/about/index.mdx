**Hey!**

I'm Nikita Volodarskiy a <code>Data Analytics Consultant</code>. While I'm not a Software Engineer, I do have experience in web development. Mainly because of my university past. We had quite some projects together with professores and student communities. None of which were successful to bring money, but I learned a lot.

I've always been a bit of a geek, and I still **enjoy building things** just out of curiosity. Now is the perfect era for pet projects. With AI, I can create in a day what used to take me weeks.

I can finally focus on interesting features, rather than routine setup and boilerplate code.

This site is a **collection of my notes, thoughts, and projects** that I find interesting. It's a way for me to document my journey and share it with others.

Web site was developed based on [Eva.Town](https://github.com/evadecker/eva.town).  
Hosted on GitHub pages, using GitHub Actions for deployment.
