My brother came to me and asked if I could use ChatGPT-5 to vibecode something.

I said, “Sure, why not!”

And that’s how this project started. The idea was quite simple: create a site with a catalog of musical instruments, where you can select one and then play it using your keyboard (or touchscreen).

When writing this note, I had implemented exactly two features:
- A main page with the instrument catalog
- A page for each instrument, with a playable keyboard

So far, there’s only one instrument — a synth kalimba. It sounds a bit cringe, since it’s not sampled from a real kalimba but instead generated as a robotic sound.
