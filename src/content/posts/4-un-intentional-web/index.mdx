I remember how intentional it was back in the day. It wasn’t available in the palm of my hand, I would need to switch on the desktop PC first.

On social networks I was following my friends, and all the post updates were in the order of the date published. Algorithms were simple back in the day.

I understand, the major part of what I feel is nostalgia. Like your granddad bragging about food being tastier and girls being nicer.

However, I am pretty sure there’s something useful for you too in my idea. Recently I realised how consumed I was with smart algorithms. Social networks have become no longer intentional and, well, less social.

Instagram, the place where I loved to share updates with my friends and learn from them, turned into a platform for creators. 90% of my time on Instagram was spent watching Reels lately.

And it’s hard to fight. I mean, those algorithms are exploiting our weaknesses, our biological features, and turning them into weak spots.

It’s like vape companies hiring the best flavorists and scientists to make sure it’s impossible to stop vaping their e-liquid. Corporations like Meta are very well aware of human behaviour and how to keep our attention and focus to profit from it.

I want to be done with it. Not cold-turkey done. Slowly working on my habits and lifestyle. This is one of the reasons I created this blog.

I don’t want this to be a part of any social or blogging platform. If you are reading this, odds are it’s intentional. 

Also, I am working on a project to bring blog post updates and news in an intentional way. This is something I want for myself: no infinite scrolling, no recommendations. Just a subscription to my favourite blogs and news sites, so that I can log in, check the latest updates (say, the latest 10 posts), read only those that are interesting, and close it until the next day.

But this post is not about that service. This post is the beginning of my idea: to bring back the intentional web. First of all to myself, but why should it be only me who benefits? I invite you to follow me.
