title: AI vs SAAS
description: Sorry, one more post about AI. This won't always be like this. I've been playing this weekend with GPT-5, and I guess this is why I have so many posts about it.

I wanted a simple blog. The usual way to create a blog is to use a CMS like WordPress. I didn’t want to do that. WordPress is too heavy - so many plugins, so many features that I don’t need.

I googled and found [bearblog.dev](https://bearblog.dev/). This is a simple blog engine that is easy to use and has a nice design. I liked it, but I wanted to have more control over the design and functionality. And it’s not completely free - you have to pay for some features.

So I was like, why do I need to pay for something that I can do myself? I know how to create web applications. With AI help, I can create a simple blog in a day. And I did it!

This gives me an interesting thought on the future of SAAS. SAAS is software as a service, developed by a company and provided to users, usually for a fee.

I think it’s possible that people will start creating their own solutions with AI help, instead of using third-party applications. This gives us a lot of freedom. We can create solutions tailored to our needs, without relying on third-party services. And those solutions will be free to use (except for hosting and AI costs).

I want to continue this. I want to give it proper thought - what services I use, what I can replace with my own solution, and how I can save another $10 per month.

Don’t get me wrong, I don’t want to do it only to save money. I like to create things, and vibecoding is like the IKEA of software.
