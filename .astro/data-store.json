While I'm not a Software Engineer, I do have experience in web development. Mainly because of my university past. We had quite some projects together with professores and student communities. None of which were successful to bring money, but I learned a lot.\n\nI've always been a bit of a geek, and I still **enjoy building things** just out of curiosity. Now is the perfect era for pet projects. With AI, I can create in a day what used to take me weeks.\n\nI can finally focus on interesting features, rather than routine setup and boilerplate code.\n\nThis site is a **collection of my notes, thoughts, and projects** that I find interesting. It's a way for me to document my journey and share it with others.\n\nWeb site was developed based on [Eva.Town](https://github.com/evadecker/eva.town).  \nHosted on GitHub pages, using GitHub Actions for deployment.\n\nYou can find me here:\n- [Telegram](https://t.me/n_volodarskiy) – preffered way of communication\n- [GitHub](https://github.com/NickWatsonMan)\n- [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nsvolodarskiy/)","src/content/pages/about/index.mdx","3813c160ded3f1b5",true,"posts",["Map",42,43,52,53],"1-web-app-music-catalog",{"id":42,"data":44,"body":49,"filePath":50,"digest":51,"deferredRender":39},{"title":45,"description":46,"datePublished":47,"dateModified":48},"Web app - Music instruments keyboard","Notes on music instuments catalog project.",["Date","2025-08-16T06:00:00.000Z"],["Date","2025-08-16T06:00:00.000Z"],"My brother came to me and asked if I could use ChatGPT-5 to vibecode something.\n\nI said, “Sure, why not!”\n\nAnd that’s how this project started. The idea was quite simple: create a site with a catalog of musical instruments, where you can select one and then play it using your keyboard (or touchscreen).\n\nWhen writing this note, I had implemented exactly two features:\n- A main page with the instrument catalog\n- A page for each instrument, with a playable keyboard\n\nSo far, there’s only one instrument — a synth kalimba. It sounds a bit cringe, since it’s not sampled from a real kalimba but instead generated as a robotic sound.","src/content/posts/1-web-app-music-catalog/index.mdx","67aca32bc1d5b2c2","2-chatgpt-mvp-rocket",{"id":52,"data":54,"body":59,"filePath":60,"digest":61,"deferredRender":39},{"title":55,"description":56,"datePublished":57,"dateModified":58},"GPT-5 MVP Rocket speed","Playing with ChatGPT models.",["Date","2025-08-17T06:00:00.000Z"],["Date","2025-08-17T06:00:00.000Z"],"Started morning with playing with ChatGPT-5. Today I asked it to develop a backend + frontend web app for RSS feeds management. Functionality: signup, auth, subscribe to multiple RSS feed, fetch on schedule and manually.\n\nGPT sent me .zip with the project and asked to run with docker. Tried – frontend critical error. Asked to debug, retried – backend critical error. Asked a couple of times to debug and it worked!\n\nJust wow! I mean there are lots of files, lots of scripts that work together. The app does what I’ve asked it to.\n\nAnd now I can use this as a base, as MVP, that I will improve to make a product that I have in my head.\n\nI have some web development experience, but I would spend a week just to setup this MVP with routine functionality. But now, with GPT’s help I can focus on interesting features.","src/content/posts/2-chatgpt-mvp-rocket/index.mdx","3e59a06897c40929"]
