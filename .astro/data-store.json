Functionality: signup, auth, subscribe to multiple RSS feed, fetch on schedule and manually.\n\nGPT sent me .zip with the project and asked to run with docker. Tried – frontend critical error. Asked to debug, retried – backend critical error. Asked a couple of times to debug and it worked!\n\nJust wow! I mean there are lots of files, lots of scripts that work together. The app does what I’ve asked it to.\n\nAnd now I can use this as a base, as MVP, that I will improve to make a product that I have in my head.\n\nI have some web development experience, but I would spend a week just to setup this MVP with routine functionality.
