# Nikita Volodarskiy

This repository hosts the code for [volodarskiy.space](https://volodarskiy.space), my personal corner of the internet. Here I publish life updates, long-form posts, and experiments with new technologies.

## Recent Life Updates

- **2024-07:** Rebuilt the site using Astro 5.
- **2024-05:** Started a series of posts about building small web apps.
- **2024-03:** Moved to a new city and looking for interesting collaborators.

## Blog

Articles live under [`src/content/blog`](src/content/blog) and are written in Markdown/MDX. Each post contains a `datePublished` field and an optional `dateModified` to track updates.

You can subscribe to new posts via the site's [RSS feed](https://volodarskiy.space/rss.xml).

## Getting Started

To run the site locally:

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Run linting and type checks:

```bash
pnpm check
```

Run tests:

```bash
pnpm test
```

## Tech Stack

- [Astro](https://astro.build) for the static site
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and MDX for content
- [Biome](https://biomejs.dev/) for formatting and linting
- [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) for end-to-end tests
